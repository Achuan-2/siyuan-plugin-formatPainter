## 🚀 Background

When taking notes in SiYuan Note and needing to add styles, it can be quite troublesome to apply multiple overlapping styles to text simultaneously, such as background color + bold, let alone three or more styles (like font color + font size + bold) 😖💔

Therefore, inspired by the format painter in Office, I developed this format painter plugin, hoping it can be your little helper in beautifying SiYuan notes, saving you time and quickly enhancing your notes! 💃🕺

## ✨ Feature Introduction

- Enter format painter mode: Select text and click the "Format Painter" button on the floating toolbar to copy the style (supports overlapping styles). Then, select other text to automatically and quickly apply the copied style.
  - Supported inline styles for copying: font size, background color, text color, bold, inline code, keyboard style, underline, strikethrough, superscript, subscript, highlight, etc.
  - Supports copying **no style** to clear the selected text style
- Exit format painter mode: Press the Esc key
