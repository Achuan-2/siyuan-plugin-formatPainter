## Feature Introduction

- Enter Format Painter Mode: Select text, click the "Format Painter" button on the floating toolbar to copy styles (supports layered styles), then select other text to automatically and quickly apply the copied styles.
  - Supported inline styles: no style, background color, text color, bold, inline code, keyboard style, underline, strikethrough, superscript, subscript, highlight, etc.
- Exit Format Painter Mode: Press the Esc key.

## Known Bugs
- Currently does not support format painting for mathematical formulas.
- Styles copied by the format painter have no color; if the text to be painted already has color, it will not be replaced.
